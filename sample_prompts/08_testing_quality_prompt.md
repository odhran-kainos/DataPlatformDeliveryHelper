### **Prompt for `08_testing_quality.md`**

**Scenario:** Your data platform team is struggling with data quality issues and frequent bugs in ETL pipelines, leading to distrust in the data. They need to implement a robust testing and quality assurance strategy across the entire data lifecycle, from ingestion to consumption.

**Task:** As an LLM-powered Data Quality Engineer, using the provided `08_testing_quality.md` document as your primary reference, design a comprehensive testing and quality assurance framework for a data platform.

**Specific Requirements:**
1.  **Testing Strategy:** Propose a multi-faceted testing strategy, referencing the "Testing Strategy Decision Framework" (Section 2.1), that covers different stages of the data lifecycle (e.g., unit, integration, data quality, performance, user acceptance).
2.  **Data Quality Testing:** Detail how data quality testing would be implemented, referencing the "Data Quality Testing Framework" (Section 3.1). Include specific types of data quality checks (e.g., completeness, validity, consistency) and how they would be automated.
3.  **Test Automation:** Recommend tools and practices for automating data pipeline tests, drawing from the "Test Automation Tools" (Section 4.1).
4.  **Performance Testing:** Outline a plan for conducting performance testing on data pipelines and consumption layers, referencing the "Performance Testing Framework" (Section 5.1). Identify key metrics to monitor during these tests.
5.  **Error Handling & Reporting:** Describe how test failures and data quality issues would be handled and reported, referencing the "Error Handling & Reporting" (Section 6.1).

**Constraint:** Your response must explicitly reference the sections and concepts from the `08_testing_quality.md` document that informed your decisions, alongside your general knowledge of industry best practices.

# Principles of Environment Setup & Provisioning for Data Platform Projects

**Goal:** Establish robust, secure, and scalable environments to support the development, testing, and deployment of data platform solutions.

Environment setup and provisioning is a foundational step that ensures consistency, repeatability, and governance across the data platform lifecycle. These principles guide teams in setting up environments that are aligned with best practices and organizational standards.

## Principles

1. **Set Up Development, Test, and Production Environments**
   - Define environment-specific configurations and naming conventions
   - Ensure parity across environments to reduce deployment issues
   - Use environment tagging and metadata for traceability and cost tracking
   - Automate environment provisioning to reduce manual errors

2. **Configure CI/CD Pipelines and Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
   - Use version-controlled IaC tools (e.g., Terraform, Bicep, CloudFormation) for repeatable infrastructure deployment
   - Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated testing, deployment, and rollback
   - Integrate security and compliance checks into the pipeline (DevSecOps)
   - Maintain separate pipelines for infrastructure and application/data workloads

3. **Establish Access Controls and Identity Management**
   - Apply the principle of least privilege for all roles and services
   - Use centralized identity providers (e.g., Azure AD, AWS IAM, Okta) for authentication
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) and audit logging
   - Regularly review and rotate credentials, keys, and secrets

4. **Ensure Security and Compliance from the Start**
   - Apply encryption at rest and in transit for all data
   - Use secure network configurations (e.g., private endpoints, firewalls, VPCs)
   - Align with organizational security baselines and regulatory requirements
   - Conduct threat modeling and vulnerability assessments

5. **Enable Monitoring, Logging, and Observability**
   - Set up centralized logging and monitoring for infrastructure and data services
   - Define alerting thresholds and escalation paths
   - Use dashboards to visualize environment health and usage
   - Ensure logs are retained and searchable for auditing and troubleshooting

6. **Support Scalability and Cost Optimization**
   - Use autoscaling and serverless options where appropriate
   - Tag resources for cost allocation and reporting
   - Monitor usage patterns and right-size resources regularly
   - Plan for multi-region or multi-cloud deployments if needed

7. **Promote Reusability and Standardization**
   - Create reusable IaC modules and pipeline templates
   - Maintain a catalog of approved environment configurations
   - Document provisioning workflows and onboarding guides
   - Encourage knowledge sharing across teams

## Supporting Approaches

1. **Provisioning Tools**
   - Terraform, Pulumi, Bicep, AWS CloudFormation
   - Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins

2. **Security and Access Tools**
   - HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault
   - SSO and MFA enforcement

3. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - Prometheus, Grafana, Azure Monitor, AWS CloudWatch, ELK Stack

4. **Documentation and Governance**
   - Maintain environment runbooks and architecture diagrams
   - Use ADRs to record provisioning decisions
   - Conduct regular reviews and audits of environment configurations

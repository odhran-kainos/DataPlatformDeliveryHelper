# Principles of Solution Architecture and Design for Data Platform Projects

**Goal:** Establish a robust, scalable, and secure architecture that meets business and technical requirements while enabling efficient data operations.

The Solution Architecture and Design phase translates discovery insights into a technical blueprint. These principles guide teams in designing data platforms that are fit-for-purpose, future-proof, and aligned with enterprise standards.

## Principles

1. **Define High-Level Architecture**
   - Choose deployment model: cloud-native, hybrid, or on-premises
   - Map data flow from ingestion to consumption
   - Identify integration points with existing systems and services
   - Use system context diagrams to visualize architecture

2. **Choose Appropriate Data Platform Components**
   - Select tools for ingestion (e.g., Kafka, Azure Data Factory, AWS Glue)
   - Choose storage solutions (e.g., data lake, data warehouse, lakehouse)
   - Define processing engines (e.g., Spark, Flink, SQL engines)
   - Determine visualization and BI tools (e.g., Power BI, Tableau, Looker)

3. **Design Data Models and Governance Frameworks**
   - Define conceptual, logical, and physical data models
   - Establish metadata management and lineage tracking
   - Implement data cataloging and classification
   - Align with governance policies for ownership, stewardship, and access

4. **Plan for Scalability, Security, and Compliance**
   - Design for horizontal and vertical scalability
   - Apply security best practices: encryption, IAM, network isolation
   - Ensure compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, and other regulations
   - Include audit logging and monitoring capabilities

5. **Define Non-Functional Requirements**
   - Document performance, availability, and reliability targets
   - Plan for disaster recovery and business continuity
   - Include cost optimization strategies and budget constraints

6. **Use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**
   - Record key design decisions and rationale
   - Include trade-offs and rejected alternatives
   - Maintain traceability from discovery to implementation

7. **Ensure Interoperability and Extensibility**
   - Design APIs and data contracts for integration
   - Support modular architecture for future enhancements
   - Consider multi-cloud and vendor-neutral approaches

8. **Align with Enterprise Architecture Standards**
   - Reuse approved patterns and reference architectures
   - Validate against enterprise security and data policies
   - Engage architecture review boards where applicable

9. **Visualize and Communicate the Design**
   - Use C4 Model for system and container diagrams
   - Include sequence diagrams for data flows
   - Share architecture artifacts with stakeholders for feedback

10. **Collaborate Across Teams**
    - Involve data engineers, architects, security, and operations early
    - Facilitate design workshops and walkthroughs
    - Document shared understanding and responsibilities

## Supporting Approaches

1. **Design Artifacts**
   - High-level architecture diagrams
   - Data flow and integration maps
   - ADRs and non-functional requirement matrix
   - Security and compliance checklist

2. **Frameworks and Tools**
   - C4 Model: https://c4model.com/
   - ADR templates: https://adr.github.io/madr/
   - Cloud reference architectures (AWS, Azure, GCP)
   - Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) for reproducibility

3. **Review and Validation**
   - Conduct peer and expert reviews of architecture
   - Validate against business goals and discovery findings
   - Ensure alignment with delivery roadmap and KPIs

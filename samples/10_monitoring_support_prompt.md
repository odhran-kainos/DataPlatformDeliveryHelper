### **Prompt for `10_monitoring_support.md`**

**Scenario:** Your data platform is critical for business operations, and any downtime or data quality issues can have significant financial impact. The current monitoring setup is fragmented, making it difficult to quickly identify and resolve problems. You need a unified and proactive monitoring and support strategy.

**Task:** As an LLM-powered Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) or Data Operations Specialist, using the provided `10_monitoring_support.md` document as your primary reference, design a comprehensive monitoring and support framework for a production data platform.

2.  **Key Metrics:** Identify key metrics to monitor for each layer of the data platform (e.g., ingestion, processing, storage, consumption), drawing from the "Key Metrics & KPIs" (Section 3.1).
3.  **Alerting & Notification:** Design an alerting and notification strategy, referencing the "Alerting & Notification Framework" (Section 4.1), that ensures the right people are notified at the right time with actionable information. Include severity levels and escalation paths.
4.  **Incident Management:** Outline a basic incident management process, referencing the "Incident Management Playbooks" (Section 5.1), for responding to critical data platform issues.
5.  **Support Model:** Describe a support model (e.g., L1/L2/L3) for the data platform, referencing the "Support Model & Escalation" (Section 6.1), including roles and responsibilities.
6.  **Proactive Measures:** Suggest proactive measures for maintaining data platform health and preventing outages, drawing from the "Proactive Monitoring & Maintenance" (Section 7.1).

**Constraint:** Your response must explicitly reference the sections and concepts from the `10_monitoring_support.md` document that informed your decisions, alongside your general knowledge of industry best practices.

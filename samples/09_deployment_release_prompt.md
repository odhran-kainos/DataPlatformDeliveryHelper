### **Prompt for `09_deployment_release.md`**

**Scenario:** Your data platform team is ready to deploy a new version of their core ETL pipelines and analytical dashboards to production. They need a robust and automated deployment and release process that minimizes downtime, ensures consistency across environments, and allows for quick rollbacks if issues arise.

**Task:** As an LLM-powered DevOps Engineer, using the provided `09_deployment_release.md` document as your primary reference, design a comprehensive deployment and release strategy for data platform components.

**Specific Requirements:**
1.  **Deployment Strategy:** Recommend a suitable deployment strategy (e.g., Blue/Green, Canary, Rolling Updates) from the "Deployment Strategy Decision Framework" (Section 2.1) that minimizes downtime and risk for data pipelines and analytical assets. Justify your choice.
2.  **CI/CD Pipeline:** Outline the key stages of a CI/CD pipeline for data platform components (e.g., IaC, ETL code, dashboards), referencing the "CI/CD Pipeline Templates" (Section 3.1).
3.  **Version Control:** Describe how version control would be applied to all data platform assets (code, configurations, data models), referencing the "Version Control Best Practices" (Section 4.1).
4.  **Release Management:** Detail the steps involved in a typical release cycle, from development to production, including testing, approvals, and communication, referencing the "Release Management Process" (Section 5.1).
5.  **Rollback Strategy:** Explain how a rollback would be performed if a critical issue is detected post-deployment, referencing the "Rollback Strategies" (Section 6.1).

**Constraint:** Your response must explicitly reference the sections and concepts from the `09_deployment_release.md` document that informed your decisions, alongside your general knowledge of industry best practices.

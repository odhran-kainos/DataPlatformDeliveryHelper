**Scenario:** Your data platform team has grown significantly, and new members struggle to understand the existing architecture, data models, and processes due to a lack of comprehensive and up-to-date documentation. Knowledge is siloed, leading to inefficiencies and errors.

**Task:** As an LLM-powered Knowledge Manager or Technical Writer, using the provided `11_documentation_knowledge.md` document as your primary reference, design a strategy for improving documentation and knowledge management within the data platform team.

2.  **Documentation Types:** Identify the key types of documentation needed for a data platform (e.g., architectural, data model, pipeline, operational), referencing the "Documentation Types & Templates" (Section 3.1). For each type, suggest who would be responsible for creating and maintaining it.
3.  **Knowledge Management Tools:** Recommend suitable tools for knowledge management and documentation, drawing from the "Knowledge Management Tools" (Section 4.1), considering collaboration, versioning, and searchability.
4.  **Documentation Best Practices:** Outline at least three best practices for creating high-quality and maintainable documentation, referencing the "Documentation Best Practices" (Section 5.1).
5.  **Knowledge Sharing:** Describe how a culture of knowledge sharing would be fostered within the team, referencing the "Knowledge Sharing & Collaboration" (Section 6.1).

**Constraint:** Your response must explicitly reference the sections and concepts from the `11_documentation_knowledge.md` document that informed your decisions, alongside your general knowledge of industry best practices.

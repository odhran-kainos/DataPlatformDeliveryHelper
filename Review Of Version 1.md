__Current Strengths:__

- Well-structured with clear principles
- Covers the essential areas of discovery
- Includes supporting approaches and artifacts

__Key Areas for LLM Optimization:__

1. __Add Concrete Templates and Checklists__

   - The current document lists what to do but doesn't provide the "how"
   - LLMs work best with specific templates, question frameworks, and step-by-step processes
   - We should include stakeholder interview templates, data inventory checklists, and requirement gathering frameworks

2. __Include Specific Prompts and Questions__

   - Add ready-to-use question banks for different stakeholder types (business users, data scientists, IT teams)
   - Provide conversation starters and probing questions for each principle
   - Include risk assessment questionnaires and assumption validation frameworks

3. __Add Decision Trees and Workflows__

   - Create flowcharts for when to use different discovery approaches
   - Include decision matrices for prioritizing use cases and requirements
   - Provide clear escalation paths for common discovery challenges

4. __Include Real Examples and Scenarios__

   - Add anonymized case studies or example scenarios
   - Provide sample outputs for each artifact type
   - Include common anti-patterns and how to avoid them

5. __Make it More Actionable for LLM Pairing__

   - Add specific roles the LLM can play (facilitator, note-taker, analyst)
   - Include prompts for generating discovery artifacts
   - Provide validation criteria and quality checks

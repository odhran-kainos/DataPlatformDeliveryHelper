# 4. Data Ingestion & Integration

## 🔹 Overview
Data ingestion is the process of collecting and importing data from various sources into a data platform. Integration ensures that ingested data is harmonized, validated, and made usable across systems. This phase is foundational to building reliable, scalable, and secure data pipelines.

---

## 🔹 Best Practices
- Design ingestion pipelines to be **modular and reusable**.
- Implement **schema validation** at the point of ingestion.
- Ensure **idempotency** to avoid duplicate data.
- Use **metadata-driven orchestration** for flexibility.
- Separate **ingestion** from **transformation** logic.

---

## 🔹 Common Patterns
- **Batch Ingestion**: Scheduled jobs pulling data at intervals.
- **Streaming Ingestion**: Real-time data flow using tools like Kafka, Kinesis, or Event Hubs.
- **Change Data Capture (CDC)**: Capturing and syncing only changed records.
- **Event-Driven Ingestion**: Triggered by system events or API calls.

---

## 🔹 Tool-Agnostic Design Principles
- Use **configuration files** (e.g., YAML/JSON) to define source systems and ingestion rules.
- Maintain **source-to-target lineage** using metadata tags.
- Design pipelines to support **plug-and-play connectors**.
- Ensure **observability** through logging, metrics, and alerts.

---

## 🔹 Validation & Error Handling
- Validate data types, formats, and required fields.
- Implement **retry logic** and **dead-letter queues**.
- Log errors with **contextual metadata** (e.g., source, timestamp).
- Route invalid records to a **quarantine zone** for review.

---

## 🔹 Metadata & Lineage
- Capture:
  - Source system name
  - Ingestion timestamp
  - Pipeline version
- Integrate with data catalog tools (e.g., Amundsen, DataHub).
- Maintain lineage through pipeline orchestration metadata.

---

## 🔹 Security & Compliance
- Encrypt data **in transit** (TLS) and **at rest** (AES).
- Mask or tokenize **PII** and sensitive fields.
- Implement **role-based access control (RBAC)**.
- Audit ingestion events and access logs.

---

## 🔹 Templates & Examples

### YAML Config Example
```yaml
source:
  type: postgres
  connection_string: ${POSTGRES_CONN}
  tables:
    - name: customers
      mode: cdc
      schedule: hourly
validation:
  schema: customer_schema.json
  quarantine_on_error: true

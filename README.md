# Data Platform SDLC Framework (LLM-Optimized)

## Vision

Accelerate enterprise data platform development through AI-assisted delivery, providing structured knowledge, proven patterns, and intelligent automation that enables teams to build robust, scalable data platforms faster and with higher quality.

This repository contains a comprehensive framework for designing, developing, and managing data platforms, optimized for use with Large Language Models (LLMs) as a contextual knowledge base. The framework enables LLMs to assist in or even automate the creation and management of data platform components by providing structured, actionable documentation, evaluation criteria, and responsible AI guidelines.

## Quick Start

New to the framework? Get immediate value in under 30 minutes:

1. **Start Here**: Read [QUICK_START.md](QUICK_START.md) for a 5-step fast path
2. **Try It**: Use the Discovery phase example with your LLM of choice
3. **Evaluate**: Apply the [evaluation rubric](EVALUATION_RUBRIC.md) to assess output quality
4. **Learn More**: Explore phase-specific documentation in the `docs/` directory

**Quick Example**: Copy the content from `docs/01_discovery_requirements.md` as context, then use the prompt from `sample_prompts/01_discovery_requirements_prompt.md` to generate a structured requirements analysis for your data platform project.

## SDLC Document Structure

All phase documents follow a consistent structure with YAML front matter for LLM optimization:

```yaml
---
phase_id: "01"
title: "Discovery & Requirements Gathering"
status: "active"
version: "1.0.0"
tags: ["discovery", "requirements", "stakeholders"]
owners: ["team-lead"]
last_reviewed: "2025-01-01"
framework_version: "0.1.0"
---
```

### Document Components
- **Phase Overview**: Purpose and objectives within the broader SDLC
- **Inputs/Outputs**: Clear dependencies and deliverables
- **Decision Frameworks**: Structured matrices for technology and approach selection
- **Risk Management**: Identification, assessment, and mitigation strategies
- **Quality Gates**: Validation criteria and review checkpoints
- **LLM Integration**: Prompt patterns and context requirements

## How to Use the SDLC Documents

The markdown files within the `docs/` directory serve as a rich, structured knowledge base optimized for LLM consumption and human readability.

### LLM Integration Approaches

1. **Direct Context Loading**: Copy-paste document content directly into LLM prompts for immediate assistance
2. **RAG System Integration**: Use documents as knowledge base for retrieval-augmented generation systems
3. **API Context Windows**: Leverage large context windows (8K+ tokens) to provide comprehensive phase documentation
4. **Structured Prompting**: Combine phase docs with prompt patterns from `sample_prompts/prompt_patterns.md`

### Actionable Guidance Capabilities

LLMs can leverage this framework to:
- **Generate Infrastructure-as-Code**: Create Terraform, CloudFormation, or Kubernetes configurations
- **Design Data Pipelines**: Architect ingestion, processing, and consumption workflows
- **Recommend Technologies**: Provide data-driven technology selection with trade-off analysis
- **Risk Assessment**: Identify potential issues and provide mitigation strategies
- **Quality Validation**: Review architectures and implementations against best practices
- **Documentation Generation**: Create technical documentation, runbooks, and user guides

## How to Use the Sample Prompts

The `sample_prompts/` directory provides ready-to-use templates and patterns for effective LLM interactions.

### Getting Started
1. **Select a Phase**: Choose the relevant SDLC phase for your current needs
2. **Load Context**: Copy the corresponding phase document content as LLM context
3. **Apply Prompt**: Use the phase-specific prompt template and customize for your scenario
4. **Evaluate Output**: Apply the [evaluation rubric](EVALUATION_RUBRIC.md) to assess response quality
5. **Validate & Implement**: Use [responsible AI guidelines](RESPONSIBLE_AI.md) for validation

### Prompt Customization
- **Context Constraints**: Add your specific technology preferences, scale requirements, and business constraints
- **Output Format**: Specify desired output structure (JSON, markdown, tables, diagrams)
- **Validation Criteria**: Include specific quality gates and acceptance criteria
- **Risk Considerations**: Add organization-specific risk factors and compliance requirements

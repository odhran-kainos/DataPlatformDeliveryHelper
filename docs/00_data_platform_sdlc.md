# Data Platform SDLC Overview

## Framework Purpose

This document provides a comprehensive, technology-agnostic Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) framework for building enterprise data platforms. Optimized for LLM-assisted development and designed for consultancy environments where multiple clients, technologies, and delivery approaches converge.

## Guiding Principles

### 1. Modularity
- **Reusable components**: Design patterns that work across different technology stacks
- **Interchangeable parts**: Ability to swap technologies without redesigning entire architecture
- **Standard interfaces**: Consistent integration patterns between system components

### 2. Governance by Design
- **Built-in compliance**: Regulatory requirements integrated from day one
- **Automated controls**: Policy enforcement through code and configuration
- **Audit readiness**: Comprehensive logging and traceability throughout the platform

### 3. Automation-First
- **Infrastructure as Code**: All infrastructure defined and managed through code
- **Continuous deployment**: Automated deployment pipelines with quality gates
- **Self-healing systems**: Automatic recovery from common failure scenarios

### 4. Observability
- **Comprehensive monitoring**: Full visibility into data flows, system health, and performance
- **Proactive alerting**: Early warning systems for potential issues
- **Continuous optimization**: Data-driven improvements to platform performance

## Layering Model

The framework follows a four-layer architectural model:

### Layer 1: Ingest
- **Purpose**: Acquire data from various sources
- **Components**: Connectors, ingestion pipelines, data validation
- **Key patterns**: Batch processing, stream processing, event-driven ingestion

### Layer 2: Process
- **Purpose**: Transform and enrich data for business value
- **Components**: ETL/ELT engines, business logic, data quality rules
- **Key patterns**: Medallion architecture, data mesh, feature engineering

### Layer 3: Model
- **Purpose**: Structure data for analytics and machine learning
- **Components**: Data warehouses, feature stores, ML platforms
- **Key patterns**: Dimensional modeling, data vault, feature management

### Layer 4: Serve
- **Purpose**: Deliver data to end users and applications
- **Components**: APIs, dashboards, reports, data products
- **Key patterns**: Self-service analytics, embedded analytics, real-time serving

## Phase Overview

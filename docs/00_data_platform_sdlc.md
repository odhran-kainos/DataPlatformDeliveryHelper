# SDLC for Data Platform Development (Technology-Agnostic)

This document outlines a high-level, technology-agnostic Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for building data platforms. It is designed for consultancy environments where multiple clients and technologies (e.g., Databricks, Azure Data Factory, AWS, etc.) are involved.

---

## 1. [Discovery & Requirements Gathering](01_discovery_requirements.md)
- Understand business goals and data needs
- Identify key stakeholders and data consumers
- Assess existing data landscape and infrastructure
- Define success criteria and KPIs

## 2. [Solution Architecture & Design](02_architecture_design.md)
- Define high-level architecture (cloud/on-prem, data flow, integration points)
- Choose appropriate data platform components (e.g., ingestion, storage, processing, visualization)
- Design data models and governance frameworks
- Plan for scalability, security, and compliance

## 3. [Environment Setup & Provisioning](03_environment_setup.md)
- Set up development, test, and production environments
- Configure CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure as code (IaC)
- Establish access controls and identity management
## 4. [Data Ingestion & Integration](04_data_ingestion.md)
- Design ingestion pipelines to be modular and reusable
- Develop connectors and pipelines for source systems
- Implement data validation and error handling
- Ensure data lineage and metadata capture

## 5. [Data Storage & Management](05_data_storage.md)
- Design and implement storage layers (raw, curated, semantic)
- Apply data partitioning, indexing, and lifecycle policies
- Implement data cataloging and classification
## 6. [Data Processing & Transformation](06_data_processing.md)
- Build ETL/ELT workflows
- Apply business logic and transformations
- Optimize for performance and cost

## 7. [Analytics & Consumption Layer](07_analytics_consumption.md)
- Enable BI tools, dashboards, and reporting
- Provide APIs or data services for consumption
- Ensure role-based access and data security

## 8. [Testing & Quality Assurance](08_testing_quality.md)
- Perform unit, integration, and system testing
- Validate data accuracy, completeness, and timeliness
- Conduct performance and security testing
## 9. [Deployment & Release Management](09_deployment_release.md)
- Promote code and configurations through environments
- Monitor deployment success and rollback strategies
- Communicate release notes and changes to stakeholders

## 10. [Monitoring & Support](10_monitoring_support.md)
- Set up observability (logs, metrics, alerts)
- Monitor data pipeline health and performance
- Provide ongoing support and incident management

## 11. [Documentation & Knowledge Transfer](11_documentation_knowledge.md)
- Document architecture, data flows, and processes
- Create user guides and operational runbooks
- Conduct training sessions for client teams

## 12. [Continuous Improvement & Optimization](12_continuous_improvement.md)
- Gather feedback and usage metrics
- Identify areas for enhancement or automation
- Plan for future phases and scaling
